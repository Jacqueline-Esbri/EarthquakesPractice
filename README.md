# EarthquakesPractice

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
To complete this project, I will use URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. I will then add the data to a map.

JavaScript and the D3.js library will be utilized to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. I will also use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

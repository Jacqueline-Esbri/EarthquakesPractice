# EarthquakesPractice

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
To complete this project,I will use URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. I will then add the data to a map.
